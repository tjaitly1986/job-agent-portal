            Review this PR against the project's CLAUDE.md coding standards.
            Focus on:
            - TypeScript strict mode compliance
            - Consistent API response shape ({ success, data?, error? })
            - Naming conventions (kebab-case files, PascalCase components, camelCase functions)
            - Conventional commit messages
            - No committed secrets or .env files
            - Proper error handling patterns
            - Server Components by default, "use client" only when needed
